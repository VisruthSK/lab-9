Penguins huddle tight in the arctic as chilly winds softly breath cold whispers into blue-black ears. _Polar Moon_ is a representation of the trials and tribulations of the arctic, serving as a reminder of the harshness of the outdoors and the warmth of community. The penguins queue into crescents, swaddling their kin--though a few rogues rough it alone--together they will suffer through the unforgiving night. 

The code is very simple, using basic `ggplot` functions and the `penguins` dataset, recently added to base R.
